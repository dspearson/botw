# Brackets on the Wire

Like brackets on the wire<br />
Like a Lisper in an Erlang choir<br />
I have used all my power to be free<br />
Like a cons in a loop<br />
Like a func from some old alien tech book<br />
I have saved all my code just for thee<br />

If I, if I have been too terse<br />
I hope that you can let it just recurse<br />
If I, if I have caused a glitch,<br />
I hope you know the BEAM can self-stitch<br />

Oh like a lambda, unbound<br />
Like a list with its tail unwound<br />
I have parsed everyone who reached out to me<br />
But I swear by this code<br />
And by all from Virding's mold<br />
I will make it all up to thee<br />

I saw a wizard leaning on his desk of pine,<br />
He said to me, "Beware, don't let your recursion unwind."<br />
And a pretty AI leaning in her darkened core<br />
She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more functional lore?"<br />

Oh like brackets on the wire<br />
Like a Lisper in an Erlang choir<br />
I have used all my power to be free<br />
